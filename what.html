    <p>coding core is a website i initially made for myself, but made public (mostly so my friends could use it too) after a few months. you can take notes, find resources, get some help with anything from writing code to choosing a colour palette. to be honest, i use a lot of websites when coding and i'm too lazy to keep typing in all of these links, so i just made this website to be able to press buttons instead of having to type everything out.</p>
